		<h1>About the play</h1>
		<p>An elderly couple and aunt are waiting for a daughter to arrive home after years in Australia, but she is taking her time and the waiting is difficult. Dialogue is repeated over and over, each repetition sending the story veering in lurid and comical directions.</p>
		<p>Characters:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Brian</li>
			<li>Alice</li>
			<li>Maisie</li>
			<li>Susy</li>
			<li>Lewis</li>
			<li>Lots of children</li>
			<li>Two gunmen</li>
			<li>Young Australian woman</li>
			<li>Official</li>
			<li>Bird</li>
		</ul>
		<p><i>"Brian and Alice are married. Maisie is Brian's sister. They are all about 60. Susy, their daughter, is 35, Lewis, their son, is younger."</i></p>

		<h1>What actors need to know</h1>
		<ul class="extra-space">
			<li>Auditions are <strong>Thursday, June 1</strong> and <strong>Saturday, June 3</strong>, by appointment only.</li>
			<li>Email us at <a href="mailto:john@madtheatre.ca">john@madtheatre.ca</a> or <a href="mailto:trevor@madtheatre.ca">trevor@madtheatre.ca</a> to book an appointment time.</li>
			<li>Actors should come prepared with an acting resume and a head-shot. Don't worry if you think your resume isn't very long. And you don't need a professional head-shot.</li>
			<li>Actors should come prepared with a reading or other piece for the audition. As well, we'll also ask you to arrive early to get a chance to read through a scene or two from the play, and then you can give that a test-drive during your audition. We're not looking for something polished -- we just want to see your creativity.</li>
			<li>Auditions are at Gonzaga High School. Use the side entrance off the parking lot.</li>
			<li>Auditions will run 20 minutes.</li>
			<li>We will be casting approximately 7 - 10 actors.</li>
		</div>

		<div class="box align-left">
			<h1>Rehearsal Schedule</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Rehearsals will begin during the second or third week of August at Gonzaga High School.</li>
