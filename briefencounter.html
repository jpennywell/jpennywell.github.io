		<h1>What actors need to know</h1>
		<ul class="extra-space">
			<li>Auditions are <strong>Saturday, September 16</strong> and <strong>Sunday, September 17</strong>, 11am - 3:20pm, by appointment only.</li>
			<li>Email us at <a href="mailto:john@madtheatre.ca">john@madtheatre.ca</a> or <a href="mailto:trevor@madtheatre.ca">trevor@madtheatre.ca</a> to book an appointment time.</li>
			<li>Actors should come prepared with an acting resume and a head-shot. Don't worry if you think your resume isn't very long. And you don't need a professional head-shot.</li>
			<li>Actors should come prepared with a reading or other piece for the audition. As well, we'll also ask you to arrive early to get a chance to read through a scene or two from the play, and then you can give that a test-drive during your audition. We're not looking for something polished -- we just want to see your creativity.</li>
			<li><b>Some roles require singing. If this interests you, or not, let us know. If you are interested in a singing role, please come prepared with a piece to sing.</b></li>
			<li>Auditions are at Gonzaga High School. Use the side entrance off the parking lot.</li>
			<li>Auditions will run 20 minutes.</li>
			<li>We will be casting approximately 10 actors.</li>
		</div>

		<div class="box align-left">
			<h1>Rehearsal Schedule</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Rehearsals will begin during the third week of September at Gonzaga High School.</li>
