		<h1>Audition Details</h1>

		<div class="box align-left">
		<strong>Love and Information</strong> by Caryl Churchill<br/>
		November 10, 12, 13, 2016<br/>
		LSPU Hall
		</div>

		<h1>About the play</h1>
			Someone can’t get a signal. Someone won’t answer the door. Someone put an elephant on the stairs. Someone’s not ready to talk. Someone hates irrational numbers. Someone told the police. Someone got a message from the traffic light. Someone’s never felt like this before.<br/>
			<br/>
			In a rapid-fire kaleidoscope of over 55 scenes, we watch a hundred different people deal with what they know...or what they don’t know...or what they think they want to know... <em>Love and Information</em> is a play about what it means to be human, to be in love, and to have relationships when we are in a world of information overload.<br/>
			<br/>

		<h1>What actors need to know</h1>
		<ul class="extra-space">
			<li>Auditions are <strong>Friday, May 27</strong> and <strong>Saturday, May 28</strong>, by appointment only.</li>
			<li>Email us at <a href="mailto:john@madtheatre.ca">john@madtheatre.ca</a> or <a href="mailto:trevor@madtheatre.ca">trevor@madtheatre.ca</a> to book an appointment time.</li>
			<li>Actors should come prepared with an acting resume and a head-shot. Don't worry if you think your resume isn't very long. And you don't need a professional head-shot.</li>
			<li>We'll try to double-book audition slots. This means you'll have a partner to act with for your audition.</li>
			<li>Actors do not need to prepare a reading or other piece for the audition. We'll ask you to arrive early to get a chance to read a scene or two from the play, and then you can give it a test-drive during your audition. We're not looking for something polished -- we want to see what kind of character or scene you can create on the spot.</li>
			<li>Auditions will run 20 minutes.</li>
			<li>We will be casting about a dozen actors.</li>
		</div>

		<div class="box align-left">
			<h1>Rehearsal Schedule</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Rehearsals will begin early in September at Gonzaga High School.</li>
				<li>We will likely have some table reads or other exploration sessions before September rehearsals begin.</li>
				<li>Rehearsal times will be discussed with actors at their audition.</li>
			</ul>
