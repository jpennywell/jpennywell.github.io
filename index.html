						Someone can’t get a signal. Someone won’t answer the door. Someone put an elephant on the stairs. Someone’s not ready to talk. Someone hates irrational numbers. Someone told the police. Someone got a message from the traffic light. Someone’s never felt like this before.<br/>
						<br/>
						In a fast-moving kaleidoscope of over 55 scenes, we watch a hundred different people deal with what they know...or what they don’t know...or what they think they want to know...<br/>
						<br/>
						<em>Love and Information</em> is a play about what it means to be human, to be in love, and to have relationships in a world of information overload.<br/>

						Brendan - thick as what all - gets a phone call from his ex: Emily. "I screwed up real bad", she says. She rambles: "I did what she said with the brick, I didn't know it was bad, but The Pin's on it now for poor Frisco and they're playing it all on me."
	                    Brendan's not looking for a patch up. He just wants to help her deal with ... whatever this is.
	                    And then she turns up dead.
	                    What's left to do?
	                    Get the straight, and break some deserving teeth.
