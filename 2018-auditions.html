		<h1>About the play</h1>
		<p>In this action-packed samurai story set inside the halls of an all-American high school, Begets: Fall of a High School Ronin tells the tale of Emi Edwards, a high school geekgurl who's fighting to overthrow the cruel shoguns of her school. However in her journey to right wrongs, will her own cravings for popularity and power corrupt her quest to save the school? Will she able to establish a new world order? Or will violence just beget more violence?</p>
        <p>From the Author: "It's All-American High School meets Japanese Manga....It's clearly 'Scott Pilgrim' for the stage with all the irreverent turns and video game callbacks...at it's heart, it's about bullying and love."</p>
